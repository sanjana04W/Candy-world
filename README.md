# Candy World 🍭 

A modern and responsive multi-category e-commerce platform built for **Candy World**, a retail business in Sri Lanka specializing in imported candies, chocolates, cosmetics, gourmet foods, and snacks.

# 📖 About the Project

Candy World is a full-stack e-commerce platform developed to digitize the business operations of Candy World, a retail store located in Colombo, Sri Lanka.

Previously, customers had to contact the business via TikTok or WhatsApp to place orders manually. This project introduces a professional online shopping platform where customers can browse products, add items to the cart, place orders, and receive deliveries through Cash on Delivery (COD).

The system also provides a secure Admin Dashboard that enables administrators to manage products, categories, inventory, customer orders, promotions, and customer information from one centralized platform.
